            "also in cases where because of that disaster the cellular infrastructure is damaged. satellite communication can be used as fall back for these cases. ideally the user equipment ( ue ) and way of working when cellular networks are available should also be usable with satellite access. global roaming : applications like tracking and tracing of containers need to be available globally across satellite and terrestrial networks. when a container is in a harbour or transported on a truck, using a terrestrial cellular network is probably most efficient. however, when the container is on a ship in the middle of an ocean, only satellite communication is possible. broadcasting : satellite communication is particularly suitable to broadcast the same information over a very wide area. this can also be used in context of 5g mobile edge applications ( e. g. mobile gaming ), where application content needs to be available in many different edge locations. to address such use cases, 3gpp has set key performance indicator ( kpi ) targets for satellite in ts 22. 261 [ 1 ]. at 5g core network architecture level, in sa2, a dedicated study on architecture aspects for using satellite access in 5g ( fs _ 5gsat _ arch ) was conducted to select the solutions able to cope with satellite specific key issues. the outcome of the study ( tr 23. 737 [ 2 ] ) identifies the impacts of satellite integration in the 5gs and solutions to adjust the 5g system accordingly. the 5gsat _ arch work item, following the study, updated architecture specifications ( ts 23. 501 [ 4 ], ts 23. 502 [ 5 ], ts 23. 503 [ 6 ] ) to implement the solutions identified. in ct1, tr 24. 821 [ 3 ] studied \" non - terrestrial impact of plmn selection procedure \" and, following 5gsat _ arch _ ct, led to update ts 23. 122 [ 7 ] and ts 24. 501 [ 8 ]. furthermore, ran has defined \" 3gpp defined radio access networks supporting non - terrestrial networks \" [ 10 ], described in the next clause. architectural / general aspects a plmn core network can be connected to a satellite ng - ran. a satellite ng - ran can be shared between more than one core networks. satellite ng - ran can be used as a new ran 3gpp access but also as backhaul between the core and terrestrial access network, providing a transport for the n1 / n2 / n3 reference points. multi - connectivity and urllc over satellite are not considered in rel\n",
